# Devlog 5 - Nature Museum Revisit and Class Discussions

* I enjoyed the presentations and discussions we had in class this week surrounding ownership and authority in regard to museums and digital information as well as the preservation of digital information, assets, and media and the plans, procedures, and challenges surrounding this practice
* Micah’s question: Is using online databases a viable replacement for visiting museums in person? What is the difference? Brought on a very interesting discussion
  * I particularly liked Jess’s point on context and meaning because it allowed me to think of the question from a different perspective that I would not have considered otherwise. 
  * Similarly to what Elise said in class, it does really depend on who is using the material held by a museum. For example, as a student myself using online databases is a viable replacement for visiting museums in person because I am usually looking for objects or documents that I can use as primary sources in my essays and projects. As long as the information is properly digitized and accessible it serves the purpose I need it to, I do not necessarily need to visit them in person to get the information. This was my initial answer to the question, and I still stand by it. 
  * However, in regard to Jess’ point there is something to be said of the value of visiting museums in person because of the context and meaning associated with the physicality of the object. That is where the object is located in the museum, what objects are displayed with it (if any), how is the object displayed, how are other visitors interacting with it etc. That is something that you cannot experience via an online database. 
  * I suspect that our digitization projects with the museums will be an extremely viable replacement for visiting the museums in person, or rather the specific material we’re working on in person, in fact to me this seems to be the goal of getting the information digitized so that it is more accessible. 
* The topic of digital preservation was something new to me and I enjoyed looking at it more depth in preparation for my seminar lead
* It was nice that I was able to make a lot of connections between the reading material and our museum visits as well as our own digitization projects 
  * For example, in the Houghton reading she discusses ten challenges currently facing digital preservation and some of these challenges came up in our museum visits like the issue of data volumes, hardware and storage, and resourcing. And it is likely that we will experience similar challenges in our own projects. My group is already experiencing the challenge of data volumes and where to focus our attention first in terms of digitization. 
  * I enjoyed the second reading on the 8th Hussars case study with the CHIN toolkit, as well as the additional reading I did regarding the CMH’s use of the toolkit. I liked how this linked digital preservation to real museums that we have had the chance to interact with. It made the challenge and importance of digital preservation more real. It was helpful to hear Callum’s input as someone who has had experience working with the Ottawa museums and saw firsthand their digital preservation techniques and the challenges they faced and continue to face. It is apparent that digital preservation is important and museums want to get a handle on it but they just do not have plans or procedures in place to do it effectively.
* As for the digitization project, myself and the rest (aside from Alina) of the Nature Museum group were able to visit the museum’s library to look at the archaeology site records on Feb 12
* We were able to talk a bit more in depth about the collection with Shawn(s) which provided us with some clarity on the collection, but also more questions which is all good as we’re getting to understand the collection a bit more and how we are going to digitize its information
* We developed somewhat of a plan that we would like to discuss with Prof Graham before going too far ahead, hopefully he will be able to attend one of our next visits to the museum as well 
* Our plan is as follows:
  * One catalogue at a time 
  * Take photo of entry in log book that corresponds to that catalogue 
  * One page of the catalogue at a time
  * Take photos of the catalogue cards that correspond to that catalogue, and that page 
  * Name files like so: “catalogue ref # -page # - catalogue card ref #” example: 98-1-1954
  * Upload all photos to one-drive shared folder 
  * Each catalogue has its own folder in one-drive, and each page of the catalogue has its own sub-folder for photos
  * Next steps: transfer photos to tropy and input metadata 
* We’re currently using One-Drive and multiple shared folders within it to upload and organize our photos, with hopes of using Tropy afterwards - however I am unable to open and use Tropy on my computer for some reason. I seem to have downloaded it successfully, but the application will not fully open without crashing and an error message popping up so this is a problem. I’ve tried uninstalling it and installing it again and the same issue seems to be happening, and I’ve tried to see if the problem is discussed within the Tropy user guide but no luck. It also doesn’t seem like Tropy has a sharing feature that would allow us all to work on the metadata all at once so we’re unsure about how that part of the project will go when we get to it. 
* The process seems pretty daunting so far, if the plan we have works and aligns with what we are supposed to be doing we think we will only be able to digitize one catalogue at most by the end of the term 
* We’re most likely planning to reconvene again on the Wednesday and Friday the week after the break, probably two different days as not one day works for our entire group, this will allow everyone to go and work on digitizing the collection and hopefully Prof Graham can attend one of those days
