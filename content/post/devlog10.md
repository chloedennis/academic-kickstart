# Devlog 10 - Editing Data
* Arianna was able to transfer the data from the output-march23.txt file into an excel sheet into a data table which she granted me sharing access to in order to cross reference the data table with the photos of the catalogue pages
* the main things I had to edit was mainly data not lining up properly, in other words the digital data not mimicking the data on the physical pages in its organization. I ensured the animal names lined up with their corresponding quantities, french names and other fields
* the table has been organized into five fields:
  * **Common Name** (name for the animal/species as recognized by the average person)
  * **Quantity** (how many found at the site)
  * **Scientific Name** (the scientific name for the animal/species)
  * **French Name** (the french name for the animal/species)
  * **Handwriting** (any handwriting on the physical pages)
* The other challenge was the handwriting and how that transferred to text and into the data table. Some of the handwriting directly corresponds to certain rows of data but there is handwriting at the bottom of each page which consists of a general number tally of species found. I left that in the handwriting column in its own rows as it appears in the photos not corresponding to a specific species/row of data but rather the information/data for the whole page.
* The output-march23.txt file is a combination of the data found in the summary pages of the catalogue as well as the general data entry guide dictionary which identifies and defines shortforms and outlines rules for documenting specific species
* The data entry guide pages do not fit within the data table fields of the summary pages. I am now wondering if it should be in its own table, like in a separate tab of the google sheet doc or should we even make a table for it? 
* I've emailed Arianna to see what she thinks - did not want to move forward without consultation 
* Malinda is beginning to work on putting the output2march23.txt file into a data table
