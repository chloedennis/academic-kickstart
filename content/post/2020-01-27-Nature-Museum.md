# Canadian Museum of Nature's Research and Collection Facility 

* I was excited to go to the Nature Museum's facilities today as it is the group I signed up for in putting together the heritage jam and I was not disapointed!
* The material the group will be working on did seem a bit daunting as there is a lot of data to work with, and it looks like there will be a learning curve with the content of the files due to the scientific terminology and abbreviations but I think that is what makes the project exciting, I'm looking forward to getting together as a group and devising a game plan
  * They seem hopeful and open to the possibility that the data we'll be working on could find connections within their collections and the work being done at CMH and Science and Tech which is fun
* I liked discovering a bit about the museum's history. For example, I was not aware they were joined with the CMH until 80s (?), and their museum archive was not developed until 1994 (?)
* Like the history museum staff, I enjoyed how open the nature museum staff were about their issues with the organization of data 
  * Card catalogues also split when they split with CMH
  * They are behind on their digitzation (but this is both a blessing and a curse as even though they are behind, they can learn from their peers and they still have paper records of their data)
* There was even more overlap with this visit and the CMH visit when it came to discussing their databases, and the accessibility of their collections online to the public
  * I was surprised to learn the database on their website has not been updated in six years - I should have asked why this is, it also makes me wonder how many new acquisitions they have gotten in the last 6 years that would warrant it not being updated
  * They recommended to search and use 'GBIF' as it is up to date with their collection 
  * Both museums saw, recognized and made us aware of the respective issues that exist within their databases and getting access to their collections online - it really reinforces the take away last week that digital work is done by humans not some digital robot in the sky, it takes time and there are errors
* The back rooms were SO COOL, I loved seeing (and smelling) the different bones and how they were stored and displayed. I've always wanted to attend their open house but have never gotten around to it, but this definitely convinced me to go next time
* I'm looking forward to working with the Nature Museum's files and staff on the Heritage Jam project
