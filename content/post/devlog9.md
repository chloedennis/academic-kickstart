# Devlog 9 - Overdue Update
* The semester is now being completed from home and online. I have escaped to my parent's house in Kemptville to find some solace amongst the madness. From here on out, all communication and work amongst the Nature Museum group will be online/virtual through email. 
* Last week I was able to help a classmate in explaining how to upload and incorporate photos into our devlogs. It was nice to help and also nice to share something that I learned this term that I did not know prior. 
* For the Nature group due to COVID-19 we can no longer meetup in person and no longer visit the Nature Museum to consult the material or take photos of it. So we will work with what we have.
* Aaliyah was in charge of putting the image files through the text reading software - which has now been completed! 
* We now have two .txt files
  * the first is "output-march23.txt" which includes the summary pages of the catalogue and the data entry guide
  * the second is "output2march23.txt" which includes the dictionary pages of the data entry guide that outlines the shortforms used in the catalogue
* I brought up the concern with the group that I don't think the catalogue pages themselves were ran through the text reading software - which is where the bulk of the data is for the catalogue
* Aaliyah is going to see if she missed them and run them through the software so we should expect more data files today
* In the text files the text from each photograph is separated with " ===== Processed Image - '98-summary-page-2.png' =====" the text from the photograph follows
* The next steps are to create a table for the information in the text files 
* Since there is currently two text files we have decided to split them amongst the remaining four group members
  * Two people will each take a text file and transfer the data into a table using google sheets - so that it is accessible to all group members
  * the reamaining two group members will each take one of the google sheets and cross reference the data and its organization with the photos to ensure accuracy
  * example: Arianna will transfer the text from the 'output-march23.txt' file into a google sheet and then I will cross reference it with the corresponding images of the summary pages and data entry log
* In regards to the additional text files coming later today - we will see what plan we devise to tackle that, but I imagine it would be something similar
* The finale stage once the information/data tables are complete is for an API to be created and published - which Aaliyah has agreed to do since the program is already installed on her computer
* I still feel like there is a lot of work ahead, and with only two weeks left in the semester I'm a bit overwhelmed by this along with all my other end of term work I have to complete but I will continue to contribute to the group what I can as we work towards the end goal of releasing some of the data from the collection online
