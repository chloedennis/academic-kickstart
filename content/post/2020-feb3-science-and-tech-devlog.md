# Devlog 3 - Science and Tech Museum Visit (in progress)

* The survey marker collection that my classmates will be working on seems extremely interesting. I enjoyed the amount of material the staff had pulled related to the suvery markers, it seems like there is a lot of mmaterial and support to back this project. Like the staff said, because of the amount of material surrounding the markers there are many different angles to approach the project (ie. surveyor angle, place/geography angle). I'm excited to see what my classmates do with it.  
* I appreciated the staff's discussion on the history of objects. That objects themsevles have their own history, like the survey markers, the object interacted with the space in which it came from and was created (ie. contact with nature, humans etc.). I found this connected with our discussion at the beginning of the semester surrounding the champagne bucket. Object are not just objects, they have a purpose, a history, and significance that can be uncovered by classifying it and asking questions of it. This is simply just good practice for historians when considering primary sources (physical objects or texts), it was extremely relevant and echoed much of what I've been taught throughout my degree. 
* After visiting all three museums it was interesting to see the similarities between them as well as how they differ from one another and how this fits into our course. They all face similar issues when it comes to accessibility of information online for public use, and differ in where they are at in the process of making their resources accessible as well as the methods used to make such things accessible. 
* At the beginning of this course I was interested in exploring the duality of the musuem. That is the public face of the museum in which the public interact with online and in person when visiting the museum, and the private/administrative face of the museum that is responsible for putting together the public face of the museum. Prior to this class I had only visited the museums as a visitor and seen their public representation (ther spaces, exhibits, display objects etc.), but this class has allowed me to see the private/administrative representation (databases, organization of collections and data, issues of accessibility) and it has been extremely eye-opening. I believe it was at the CMH where we discussed the fact that online work is just a group of humans with a website in front of them, it seems this is also true for museums. Museum exhibits, spaces, and collections are all put together by this private face of the museum that is made up of human beings with the public institution of the museum in front of them. The public is not always exposed to both sides of the museum, we are often only exposed to the public representation of the museum. But in reality the museum has multiple functions (preservation, collection, education) and roles (aesthetic, economic, and mystical) as outlined by Daniel Burren at the beginning of the term in his chapter "Function of the Museum". The visits to CMH, Nature, and Sci&Tech only reinforced these ideas. We saw methods of preservation at Nature when it came to the animal bones, how they were treated, stored, and maintained. The history museum gave an indepth presentation on their collections (artifacts, library and archives, archaeological collection), what each collection entailed, what topics they covered, and how much material they had in their collections. We were able to visit the new library at Sci&Tech which the staff emphasised was a place of learning and research for students, and they even discussed the types of educational projects that had been done using their material and possible projects that could be done that they would be interested in. These visits reinforced the idea that the role of the museum is multifaceted and the combination of public and private work together to create and maintain the museum as an institution.
