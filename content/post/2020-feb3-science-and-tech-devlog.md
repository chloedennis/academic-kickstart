# Devlog 3 - Science and Tech Museum Visit (in progress)

* The survery marker collection that my classmates will be working on seems extremely interesting. I enjoyed the amount of material the staff had pulled related to the suvery markers, it seems like there is a lot of mmaterial and support to back this project. Like the staff said, because of the amount of material surrounding the markers there are many different angles to approach the project (ie. surveyor angle, place/geography angle). I'm excited to see what my classmates do with it.  
* I appreciated the staff's discussion on the history of objects. That objects themsevles have their own history, like the survey markers, the object interacted with the space in which it came from and was created (ie. contact with nature, humans etc.). I found this connected with our discussion at the beginning of the semester surrounding the champagne bucket. Object are not just objects, they have a purpose, a history, and significance that can be uncovered by classifying it and asking questions of it. This is simply just good practice for historians when considering primary sources (physical objects or texts), it was extremely relevant and echoed much of what I've been taught throughout my degree. 
* After visiting all three museums it was interesting to see the similarities between them as well as how they differ from one another and how this fits into our course. They all face similar issues when it comes to accessibility of information online for public use, and differ in where they are at in the process of making their resources accessible as well as the methods used to make such things accessible. 
* At the beginning of this course I was interested in exploring the duality of the musuem. That is the public face of the museum in which the public interact with online and in person when visiting the museum, and the private/administrative face of the museum that is private and responsible for putting together the public face of the museum. Prior to this class I had only visited the museums as a visitor and seen their public representation (ther spaces, exhibits, display objects etc.), but this class has allowed me to see that private/administrative representation (databases, organization of collections and data, issues of accessibility) and it has been extremely eye-opening.
