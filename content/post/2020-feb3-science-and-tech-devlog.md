# Devlog 3 - Science and Tech Museum Visit (in progress)

* The survery marker collection that my classmates will be working on seems extremely interesting. I enjoyed the amount of material the staff had pulled related to the suvery markers, it seems like there is a lot of mmaterial and support to back this project. Like the staff said, because of the amount of material surrounding the markers there are many different angles to approach the project (ie. surveyor angle, place/geography angle). I'm excited to see what my classmates do with it.  
* I appreciated the staff's discussion on the history of objects. That objects themsevles have their own history, like the survey markers, the object interacted with the space in which it came from and was created (ie. contact with nature, humans etc.). I found this connected with our discussion at the beginning of the semester surrounding the champagne bucket. Object are not just objects, they have a purpose, a history, and significance that can be uncovered by classifying it and asking questions of it. This is simply just good practice for historians when considering primary sources (physical objects or texts), it was extremely relevant and echoed much of what I've been taught throughout my degree. 
* After visiting all three museums it was interesting to see the similarities between them as well as how they differ from one another and how this fits into our course.
