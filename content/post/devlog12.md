# Devlog 12 - The Final Product
* Thanks to Aaliyah and the help of Professor Graham the Nature Museum group has officially digitized our data and created an API! 
* The API can be found and used at this link https://place-royale-latrine.herokuapp.com/
* The data in the API is from the summary pages of the Place Royale Latrine ZIC Project catalogue as well as the data of the cuts, burns, and toothmarks found on the specimens during this project at the same sight 
* It is rewarding to see the data that Arianna and I took photos of and then put into data tables (after Aaliyah ran it through a text reader) in a much more user friendly and functional program like an API
* The process we used to digitize the data can certainly be implemented by museums like, Nature but I understand why museums are slow in the digitization process. My group and I were only able to wrap our head around digitizing about twenty pages of data I can't imagine trying to tackle an entire museum collection made up of a multitude of media. However, if we are able to share our work with the museums this class partnered with I think it would provide them a bit of hope as we showcased that this work can be done it just takes time, effort, and collaboration. 
* It is a shame we will not be able to see this data put into action at Heritage Jam, but if another class has the opportunity to work with it and perhaps have the time to digitize more than what our group did i'm sure it will provide plenty of creative opportunities
* This class is officially over now, and we have something substantial to show for it. A lot of hand work paid off! Good work to my fellow group members, I hope the other groups from our course were able to produce something as well! Can't wait to read everyone's devlogs.
