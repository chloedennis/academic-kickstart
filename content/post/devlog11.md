# Devlog 11 - Editing More Data
* Arianna was able to transfer the data from the cutsb-output.tx file into an excel sheet/data table which she granted me sharing access to so that I could cross reference the data table with the photos of the catalogue pages as this is how we decided to distribute the work again. 
* this set of data tracks the amount and type of cuts, burns, and toothmarks on the species at the excavagtion site associated with the catalogue and the data recorded on the summary pages
* the main thing I had to edit was data not lining up properly, in other words the digital data not mimicking the data on the physical pages in its organization. I ensured the animal names lined up with their corresponding quantities, scientific names and other fields. 
* I had to add two columns to the data table that the text reader did not pick up on: quantity and classification 
* the table has been organized into five fields:
  * **Card Reference** (reference number associated with the corresponding catalogue card for this data line/entry)
  * **Common Name** (common name for the animal)
  * **Location of cuts/burns/toothmarks** (where the cuts/burns/toothmarks are located on the body of the animal)
  * **Quantity** (not sure if this is how many cuts/burns/toothmarks or how many of the species found at that site)
  * **Classification** (classification of the what caused the cuts/burns/toothmarks - not sure)
  * **Types of Cuts/Burns/Toothmarks** (what kind of markings are on the species' bodies)
  * **Handwriting** (handwriting on the catalogue pages)
* As for the data entry guide data pages in the output-march23.txt file that I felt did not need to be organized into a table in my previous devlog - After an email to the group from Arianna to which we got little feedback on, Arianna and I agreed to leave it out of the data table becase we originally took pictures of the data entry guide as reference material for us when reading the catalogue pages and catalogue cards, and for it to be used at Heritage Jam but since that is not happening it is not necessary to organize into a data table, we felt. The information also does not organize into a data table well as it is just rules and definitions for data entry.
* Perhaps this could be something a future class would be able to digitize, but for our group we felt it was unecessary work right now. 
* Not sure on the progress of the output2march23.txt file data table being worked on by Malinda. Also not sure how much of this file is data entry guide pages, I think most of it is, which is what we have decided to leave out of the digitization aspect of this project. Hopefully she has seen the emails from last week regarding this decision/concern.
* Next step now that Arianna and I have finalized the data tables from the output-march23.txt and cutsb-output.txt files is to send them to Aaliyah who will create an API for the data because she is awesome and has learned how to do that!
* I'm happy with the amount of work we have been able to get done over the semester, especially during the COVID-19 changes. A lot more than I was expecting at the beginning of the term.
